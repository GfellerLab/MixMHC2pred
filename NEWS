Release notes from MixMHC2pred
========================================================================


Version 1.2 (28.06.2021)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Public release of MixMHC2pred to predict phosphoryalted HLA-II ligands.


Version 1.2 (03.02.2020)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Output contains now also the individual predictions from each allele in
  addition to the score of the best allele per peptide.
* Outputted core positions correspond now to the P1 of the binding core, counted
  from the N-terminus of the peptide (first amino acid has a value of 1).
* Added a "FAQ" document.
* There is an option to allow having unspecified amino acids in the peptide
  sequence (these should be written as "X" or "-").
* Added the option "--best_s" (see README).
* Slightly updated the %Rank computations, avoiding in general having scores of
  exactly 0, and allowing the predictions for peptides up to a size of 25 amino
  acids.
* Corrected a bug when input file was given in fasta format with multiple lines
  per peptide sequence.


Version 1.1 (14.10.2019)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Public release of MixMHC2pred accompanying the Nature Biotechnology paper.


Version 1.0 (08.02.2019)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Public release of MixMHC2pred accompanying our bioRxiv preprint.

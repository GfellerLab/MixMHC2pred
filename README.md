(available [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-019-0289-6)).

MixMHC2pred is also available as a web application:
<http://mixmhc2pred.gfellerlab.org>.

## Installation

1) Download MixMHC2pred-2.0.zip file
  (<https://github.com/GfellerLab/MixMHC2pred/releases>) and move it to a
  directory of your choice, where you have writing permissions.

2) Unzip MixMHC2pred-2.0.zip in this directory.

3) Above's zip file already contains the human alleles' definition files. If you
   want to do predictions for MHC-II alleles from other species or if you cloned
   the git repository instead of downloading this zip file, you will need to
   download the wished alleles' definition files from the page:
   <http://mixmhc2pred.gfellerlab.org/PWMdef>. These additional alleles' PWM
   definition files need to then be unzipped in the folder of your choice. The
   option `-f <folders>` is then used to indicate where these files are (see
   below for details). Alternatively, you can copy/move all downloaded allele
   definition files into the folder *PWMdef* at the root of the directory where
   MixMHC2pred is installed, to avoid using the `-f` option.

4) To test your installation, make sure you are in *MixMHC2pred-2.0* directory
   and run the following command, depending on your operating system:

   * Mac OS:   `./MixMHC2pred -i test/testData.txt -o test/out.txt -a DRB1_15_01 DRB5_01_01 DPA1_02_01__DPB1_01_01 DQA1_01_02__DQB1_05_01 DQA1_01_02__DQB1_06_02`

   * Unix:   `./MixMHC2pred_unix -i test/testData.txt -o test/out.txt -a DRB1_15_01 DRB5_01_01 DPA1_02_01__DPB1_01_01 DQA1_01_02__DQB1_05_01 DQA1_01_02__DQB1_06_02`

   * Windows:   `MixMHC2pred.exe -i test/testData.txt -o test/out.txt -a DRB1_15_01 DRB5_01_01 DPA1_02_01__DPB1_01_01 DQA1_01_02__DQB1_05_01 DQA1_01_02__DQB1_06_02`

   Your file *test/out.txt* should be the same as *test/out_compare.txt*.
   Running the software takes few seconds or more when testing lots of peptides and alleles.

   The *testData.txt* file corresponds to a subset of the HLA-II peptidomics
   data obtained from the cell line *DOHH2* in Dheilly et al., *Cancer Cell* (2020),
   containing some peptides bound to the HLA in the reverse direction.

5) (Optional) To run MixMHC2pred from anywhere on your computer, make an alias
   of MixMHC2pred executable or add it in your path.

If using a non-standard OS, it is possible to compile MixMHC2pred using the
Makefile found in the *bin* folder.

## Running

### Command

```bash
MixMHC2pred -i input_file -o output_file -a allele1 allele2 [additional options]
```

* Depending on your operating system, use MixMHC2pred, MixMHC2pred_unix or
  MixMHC2pred.exe as indicated in the installation instructions.
* Do not use spaces in your file or directory names.
* Do not use other special characters (e.g., *, ?, %, &,...) in file or directory names.

### Required arguments

* `-i <file>` or `--input <file>` (input file name):  
File listing all the peptides. It should contain two columns: the 1st column being the
sequence of the peptide and 2nd column beeing its context sequence (12 amino acids
long: 3 residues upstream of the peptide, 3 N-terminal residues of the peptide,
3 C-terminal residues of the peptide and 3 residues downstream of the peptide).
When the peptide lies near the begin or end of a protein, the corresponding
context AAs should be written as "-", i.e. for the protein *ACDEFG...* if the
peptide is *CDEFG...* the first 6 AA encoding its context should be written as
*--ACDE* (and these 6 AAs should be directly followed by the 6 AAs describing the
context near the C-terminal of the peptide). Also, if some AAs from the context
of a peptide are not known, the unknown AAs should be written with the letter *X*.
See *test/testData.txt* for an example of input file.
When using the `no_context` option (see below), then this input file should only
contain the list of the peptides, without any 2nd column of the context (an
example input file without in such a case is available at *test/testData_noContext.txt*).

* `-o <file>` or `--output <file>` (output file name):  
The name of the output file (including the directory). Peptides are kept in the
same order than in the input file.

* `-a <alleles>` or `--alleles <alleles>`:  
List of MHC-II alleles to test. If you want to make predictions with multiple
alleles, list the different alleles separated by a space (e.g.
`-a DRB1_11_01 DRB3_02_02`).  
Use the nomenclature *DRB1_03_01* for HLA-DRB1\*03:01 and
*DPA1_01_03__DPB1_04_01* for HLA-DPA1\*01:03-DPB1\*04:01. The
list of alleles available and corresponding nomenclature is given in
<http://mixmhc2pred.gfellerlab.org/PWMdef> (also given in the files
*Alleles_list_xxx.txt* in the corresponding *PWMdef* folders). Simply, the names
used in MixMHC2pred are obtained by dropping the *HLA-* from human alleles, by
replacing all "-", "*" and ":" by "_", and by placing "__" between the alpha and
beta chains forming the heterodimer (the invariant DR-alpha chains are not
indicated in the allele names as in standard practice).

### Optional arguments

* `--no_context`:  
In principle, MixMHC2pred includes the peptide context for its predictions
(i.e. corresponding to a sequence of 12 AAs in total, including AAs just before
and just after the peptide as explained above). It is nevertheless possible
to decide to not consider any context information at all, when using this option.
It is generally advised to include the context, in order to search for best
candidate epitopes. But if analyzing a posteriori pre-cleaved peptide sequences
(e.g. in experiments testing specific peptides directly, that therefore did not
need to be cleaved by the cell), it may be a good to not consider the
context encoding (often multiple overlapping epitopes are observed, so the
peptide tested may not correspond to the best peptide based on context but it
could still be recognized by the same T cells when given directly). When using
this `--no_context` option, then the input file should only contain the list of
peptides, without their context. An example input file is available at
*test/testData_noContext.txt*; results of running MixMHC2pred without the
context on this file, based on the same alleles as the first example above is
given in *test/out_noContext_compare.txt*.

* `-f <folders>` or `--allelesFolder <folders>` (folder(s) containing allele
  definitions):  
If the folder containing the PWM definition files of the alleles is not at its
default location ("path_to_exec/PWMdef"), you can give this option indicating
where these files are located. It is possible to list multiple folders, separated
by a space (when an allele is found in multiple folders, the first definition
found for this allele is used). This path can be given as a full path, a path relative
to current location, or with the special keyword *exec:* (e.g., `-f exec:PWMdef`)
to give the path relative to the root folder of MixMHC2pred executable. An other
special keyword *default* can also be used: it represents the default path where
these files are located (i.e., it is equivalent to using `exec:PWMdef`).

* `-e` or `--extra_out`:
By default, the score returned by MixMHC2pred is the final peptide presentation
*%Rank* score and this is the score recommended to use in all
analyses/predictions. If you are however interested by other intermediate
scores, you can pass the `-e` option. In this case, additional columns are
appended to the output file (first columns are the same as when running
MixMHC2pred without this option). The new columns give:
  * the *Score_...* corresponding to the raw score returned by the 2nd block of
    the neural network described in our paper, a value of 1 being the best score
    and 0 the worst. Note however that the %Rank are obtained from this score
    by taking into account the expected peptide length distribution. Note also
    that the neural network is repeated multiple times, with the returned
    %Rank / Score being the average of the %Rank / Score from the repetitions,
    respectively, so it is not possible to directly transform this returned
    Score to the %Rank.
  * *ScorePWM_...* corresponding to the binding scores based on the position
    weight matrices (eq. (2) from our manuscript). The worst score is 0 and
    bigger scores are better without having an upper limit. The corresponding
    *%RankPWM_...* are percentiles computed separately per peptide length.

### Results returned and additional information

* MixMHC2pred is meant for scoring different peptides and prioritising
  the most likely HLA-II ligands and epitopes. As it is trained on naturally
  presented peptides, it does not output a predicted affinity value, simply a
  score.

* Input should consist in a list of peptides, not proteins. Currently,
  MixMHC2pred is not cutting longer peptides/proteins into shorter fragments:
  it uses the peptides given in input as is.

* The score is computed for each allele provided in input. Results are returned
  for each allele in separate columns and additional columns give the results
  from the best allele for each peptide (columns *BestAllele* and *..._best* in
  the output file, determined by the allele that had the best score,
  i.e. the most likely allele by which the peptide would be presented).

* The two first columns of the output file give the *Peptide* and *Context*
  sequence of the peptide, which were given in the input file. When the option
  `--no_context` is used, the column *Context* is kept but it is empty.

* The scores returned (columns *%Rank*) correspond to a percentile rank (best
  score is about 0, worst score is 100). This tells among random peptides, the
  percent of peptides expected to be better presented by this allele than the given
  peptide.

* The *CoreP1_...* columns tell what is the most likely binding core position
  for the given peptide towards the given allele (this tells the position of the
  first amino acid from the binding core (which has a size of 9 aa in the
  predictions), starting at a value of 1 (i.e., if binding core corresponds to
  the 9 first amino acids from the peptide, this *CoreP1 = 1*)).

* For conveniance, the binding core sequence is also indicated for the best
  allele per peptide (column *Core_best*, for the other alleles this can be
  obtained from the *CoreP1* as indicated above).

* The *subSpec_...* columns tell in which sub-specificity the given peptide
  is likely bound toward the given allele. The value *1* corresponds to the
  main sub-specificity (the only one for most alleles). But for example
  for *DRB1\*08:01* allele a 2nd sub-specificity exists and is indicated by the
  value *2*. For alleles accomodating reverse binding, a value of *-1* indicates
  that the given peptide is bound in the reverse orientation.

* Peptides shorter than 12 amino acids, longer than 21 amino acids or
  containing non-standard amino acids are kept but with a score of "NA".
  
* The list of alleles available is provided in
  <http://mixmhc2pred.gfellerlab.org/PWMdef> (also given in the files
  *Alleles_list_xxx.txt* in the corresponding *PWMdef* folders). These files
  show the nomenclature to use when running MixMHC2pred and the standard
  nomenclature used for example in the [IPD-IMGT/HLA database](
    https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ipd/mhc/).
